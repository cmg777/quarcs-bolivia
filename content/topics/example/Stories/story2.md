<p>Once upon a time, in a small village, the population was steadily increasing. However, the village did not have enough resources to sustain the growing number of people. The villagers started to experience food and water scarcity, leading to conflicts and unhappiness. The wise village leader realized that something needed to be done to control the population growth. He encouraged families to have fewer children and also provided education and job opportunities to the women, which helped in reducing the birth rate. Slowly, the village became self-sufficient and the population stabilized, leading to peace and prosperity for all. </p>
