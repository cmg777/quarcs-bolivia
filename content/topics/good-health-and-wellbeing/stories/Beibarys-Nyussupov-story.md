A researchers tried to understand the difference in health area in cities with varying rates of sustainable development. Municipal Sustainable development index (imds) was used to identify 5 cities with highest and 5 cities with lowest levels of sustainable development in Bolivia. The bar plot was visualized and it was determined that cities with high sustainable development had scores from 70 to 80, while cities with low sustainable development had scores from 30 to 40, showing a significant difference in development.

{{< paragraph class="large" >}}
The heatmap visualization was used to identify healthcare variables that are strongly correlated with sustainable development index. It was determined that Children mortality rate and Chronic Malnutrition rates in children are variables that have the strongest and negative correlation with Municipal Sustainable development index in Bolivia areas.
Furthemore it was also identified that both Children mortality and Chronic Malnutrition rates have both strong and negative relationship with Access to 3 basic services (sanitation, water and energy) and No poverty index. As these variables increase, instances of healthcare issues decrease in Bolivia.

{{< paragraph class="large" >}}
Two scatterplot diagrams were created to show the negative relationship between health care indicators (child mortality & malnutrition) and municipal sustainable development index in Bolivia.
Both scatterplot graphs also show strong negative correlations between healthcare indicators and sustainable development index in Bolivia.

Barplot visualization was used to analyze the differences in patters of health variables in 5 cities with the highest levels of sustainable development and in 5 cities with the lowest levels of sustainable development. It was determined that there is a significant difference in instances of chronic malnutration and mortality rates among children between highly developed and least developed cities in Bolivia. 
Cities with the lowest rates of sustainable development have much higher rates of children mortality and chronic malnutrition than cities with the highest sustainable development.

Next, researchers wanted to understand to what extent a lack of access to basic three services and high poverty causes a high instances of child mortality and chronic malnutrition in least developed cities of Bolivia. Furthermore, it was lso important to understand if no-poverty and access to three basic services indexes are high in the most developed cities.
Using the bar plot visualization, it was showed that cities with the high sustainable development have relatively high access to three sanitation, water and energy. Furthermore, the poverty is very low in the most developed areas. Oppositely, cities with the lowest rate of sustainable development suffer from a big lack of access to three basic serviced and a high poverty. High poverty rates and lack of access to life services causes high instances of child mortality rates and chronic malnutrition rates.
